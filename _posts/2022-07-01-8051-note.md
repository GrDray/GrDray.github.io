## Microcontroller Block Diagram

<br>

see [http://www.edsim51.com/](http://www.edsim51.com/) for read cycle and write cycle. <br>

<br>
------------------

## Memory

#### RAM(Random Access Memory)
1. read/write
2. volatile
3. be used as data memory

#### ROM(Read Only Memory)
1. read
2. non-volatile
3. be used as program memory
4. actually also random accessible
5. actually could write only once (!a)

<br>

(!a) ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH(!b). <br>
(!b) Flash gets more popular due to its cheapness and versatility. <br>

-----------------------

## Execution Cycle
After power on:
1. load the address of first instruction into the PC(Program Counter)(!a).
2. CPU fetches the instruction from the ROM where the PC point to & put it into IR(Instruction Register).
3. instruction decoder & control unit decode the instruction and start the operation.

(!a) Typically the PC would be zero when the MCU powered up.

## 8051 Hardware
8051 has:
1. 4K ROM
2. 128 byte RAM
3. 4 parallel I/O port
4. 1 serial port
5. 2 timers

* Internal ROM
  
  4K=4096=2^12, therefore 8051 has internal ROM address bus of 12 bits wide (from 0x000 to 0xFFF).
* Internal RAM
  
  256=2^8, therefore 8 bits wide internal RAM address bus is inside (from 0x00 to 0xFF).
  * General purpose (0x00 to 0x7F)
  * SFR (0x80 to 0xFF)
* Register Banks
  
  four register banks:
  * 0x00~0x07
  * 0x08~0x0F
  * 0x10~0x17
  * 0x18~0x1F
* Bit Addressable
  
  could read/write the specific single bit
* TTL compatible
  * logical one = HIGH
  * logical zero = LOW
* Reset
  
  need the RST to be at logical one for at least 24 system clock cycle(higher than 2.5V for 8051).
